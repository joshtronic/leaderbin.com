# leaderbin.com

LeaderBin was my idea for "leaderboards as a service". The site itself was only partially done but it did have enough functionality to allow you to create and log in as a user as well as add new leaderboards and push data to said leaderboards by way of the API.

As a New Yearâ€™s resolution I am sunsetting some of my personal projects that either did not gain any traction or I simply do not have any more interest in maintaining. Thus, here is the source code for LeaderBin.com. The domain itself has since lapsed, so if you try to go there you may be viewing a site that is not representative of this source code.

Happy hacking!
